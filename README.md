<h1> Bored API</h1>
</div>

I worked on a project that used an API called Bored API.
It ensures that a user never gets bored by offering him an activity to do either solo or with others, depending on the customization of the developer.
I focused on the use of API rather than the design of the site.

This is the result: https://boredapinany.netlify.app/

This is the documentation that I used : https://www.boredapi.com/documentation
